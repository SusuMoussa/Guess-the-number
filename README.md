This is going to be a number guessing game in python.

INSTRUCTIONS:
   1. You need to have python installed on your laptop you can use VSCODE, PythonProgramize and many more.
   2. You will have to guess a number from 1 - 100.
   3. You will have three tries ( add more tries if needed ).
   4. If you guess within the three tries you win if not try again.

Fact:
     If guessing a number to 100 is hard you can decrease the number.
